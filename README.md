Hog - GitHub Javascript Blog
============================

By Yarek Tyshchenko @yarekt

This is a simple blog engine that works entirely over github pages.
There is no preprocessing involved, simply type up your blog post in the data/post directory
and it will be live on the home page.

TODO:
- Links to individual posts
- Pull Author / Timestamp data
- Template engine
- ???

Oh, it should be live at http://yarekt.co.uk
